This is the REAPER C/C++ extension plug-in mini-SDK

Paths:

sdk/             -- contains headers to use
reaper-plugins/  -- contains source to some plug-ins which are included with REAPER
                    (these are not to be used as models for well-designed plug-ins,
                    but they may be useful and/or available for LGPL compliance ;)

Paths that should be added in order to compile:

WDL/

To compile most of this, initialize the WDL submodule:

git submodule update --init WDL

git submodule update --init --recursive    # if nested modules are needed

ARA2 processor attachment:

Extensions can attach ARA2 processors directly to media items using
ARA_AttachProcessorToMediaItem() to associate a processor with an item and
ARA_DetachProcessorFromMediaItem() to remove it again. The optional stateData
parameter allows passing serialized processor state to the host.
