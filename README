This is the REAPER C/C++ extension plug-in mini-SDK

Paths:

sdk/             -- contains headers to use
reaper-plugins/  -- contains source to some plug-ins which are included with REAPER
                    (these are not to be used as models for well-designed plug-ins,
                    but they may be useful and/or available for LGPL compliance ;)
sdk/example_stream -- demonstrates basic audio streaming with reaper_stream

Paths that should be added in order to compile:

WDL/

To compile most of this, merge or symlink in WDL:

git remote add wdl https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL.git
git fetch --all
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories wdl/main

The `reaper_stream` module under `sdk/` offers basic WebSocket or SRT
connection management via `stream_open`, `stream_send`, and
`stream_receive`, allowing extensions to transmit `PCM_source_transfer_t`
audio blocks over the network. A minimal example lives in
`sdk/example_stream`.
