This is the REAPER C/C++ extension plug-in mini-SDK

Paths:

sdk/             -- contains headers to use
reaper-plugins/  -- contains source to some plug-ins which are included with REAPER
                    (these are not to be used as models for well-designed plug-ins, 
                    but they may be useful and/or available for LGPL compliance ;)

Paths that should be added in order to compile:

WDL/

To compile most of this, merge or symlink in WDL:

git remote add wdl https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL.git
git fetch --all
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories wdl/main

## ARA2 processor attachment

Extensions can now attach ARA2 processors directly to media items. Use
`ARA_AttachProcessorToMediaItem()` to associate a processor with an item and
`ARA_DetachProcessorFromMediaItem()` to remove it again. The optional stateData
parameter passed when attaching allows passing any serialized processor state
to the host.
