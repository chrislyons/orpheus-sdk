This is the REAPER C/C++ extension plug-in mini-SDK

Paths:

sdk/             -- contains headers to use
reaper-plugins/  -- contains source to some plug-ins which are included with REAPER
                    (these are not to be used as models for well-designed plug-ins, 
                    but they may be useful and/or available for LGPL compliance ;)

Paths that should be added in order to compile:

WDL/

To compile most of this, merge or symlink in WDL:

git remote add wdl https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL.git
git fetch --all
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories wdl/main

Building with CMake
-------------------

This repository includes a top-level CMake project that exposes the SDK
headers and builds a few sample plug-ins.  After cloning or linking the
WDL directory as described above, generate build files for your platform:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Specific targets can be built by name using `cmake --build build --target <name>`.
The available sample targets are:

* `example_m3u` (Windows only)
* `example_raw`
* `reaper_csurf`
* `reaper_mp3`

Use CMake's `-G` option to select a generator for your compiler or IDE.
