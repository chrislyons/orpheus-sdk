# Orpheus Suite synchronization and release management

This directory is the versioned suite coordination contract. The Orpheus SDK
repository is the system of record because it already owns the cross-cutting
release tooling and generated ShmUI-JUCE manifest check. The suite is **not** a
new superproject: FourTrack and Clip Composer retain their application-owned
SDK submodules, while FreqFinder retains its package/source resolution modes.

## Decision

Use a hybrid model:

- `orpheus-suite.json` is the human-reviewable, machine-validated manifest.
- `schema/orpheus-suite.schema.json` defines its versioned shape.
- `../tools/suite.py` is a standard-library Python coordinator.
- `.github/workflows/suite-coherence.yml` validates the manifest and safe CLI
  defaults; repository-specific build and native acceptance workflows remain in
  their owning repositories.

A dedicated manifest repository was rejected because the SDK already owns the
release/check ecosystem and a new private repository would add an ownership and
credential boundary without improving the current graph. A submodule-only
superproject was rejected because gitlinks express exact checkout commits but
not compatibility windows, generated provenance, acceptance evidence, release
channels, sequencing, or rollback policy. A monorepo was rejected because the
five repositories have independent ownership, native/macOS build boundaries,
assets, and release cadence. The coordinator is optional automation behind the
manifest, not a second source of truth.

## Evidence-backed graph

The manifest edges are based on repository evidence, not repository names:

| Provider | Consumer | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shmui` | `orpheus-sdk` | `shmui/scripts/sync-juce.sh` identifies `shmui/juce/Source` as the source of truth and mirrors it to `orpheus-sdk/packages/shmui-juce`. |
| `orpheus-sdk` | `fourtrack` | `fourtrack/.gitmodules` and `fourtrack/CMakeLists.txt` consume `third_party/orpheus-sdk`. |
| `orpheus-sdk` | `clip-composer` | `clip-composer/.gitmodules` and `clip-composer/CMakeLists.txt` consume `third_party/orpheus-sdk`. |
| `orpheus-sdk` | `freqfinder` | `freqfinder/CMakeLists.txt` supports an installed package or `ORPHEUS_SDK_SOURCE_DIR`; the observed `build-release/CMakeCache.txt` uses the source override. |
| `shmui` | `fourtrack` | `fourtrack/apps/fourtrack-mac/Generated/Shmui/provenance.json` records the ShmUI revision, SDK revision, token contract, and generated manifest hash. |
| `shmui` | `freqfinder` | `freqfinder/CMakeLists.txt` supports `SHMUI_JUCE_SOURCE_DIR`; the observed cache resolves the sibling `shmui/juce`. |

The edge direction is provider → consumer. `suite.py affected shmui` computes
its transitive downstream closure and returns the declared release order.

## Commands

Run read-only inspection from any checkout. Every mutable command requires both
`--apply` and `--yes`, a clean manifest-controller worktree, and a dedicated
workspace containing the `.orpheus-suite-workspace` marker. Never point an apply
command at the active five-repository roots.

## Channels and snapshots

The initial `workspace-20260801` record is an immutable **observed development
snapshot**, not a release claim. It records exact commits and dependency pins:

- SDK `0a9e9c34f435b9862d78ab9994ffb48a9f21e149`;
- ShmUI `11ad82bcc500cd187446841b92c5c8ac7c04fef3`;
- FourTrack `87c48b4d53ec0b3bccb1d6c03fcbe4a8ea03ba98`, SDK pin
  `8e8f56629a8aee9062635a7f07b5a03952de4408`;
- FreqFinder `2978d1c38c7ade33ca31022a1cec0f7540e29e71`, using current SDK and
  ShmUI source overrides;
- Clip Composer `3d9d324473b86babd6e5ab82bac349baead47d86`, SDK pin
  `112b49cbee32ef71276c8a451e2d1bd7f6ee7e4c`.

Development follows declared default branches. Candidate creation requires a
clean workspace, reachable exact revisions, generated-artifact freshness and
hashes, all declared checks, and passed human acceptance. Stable promotion
reuses the exact candidate snapshot and changes channel metadata only. No
moving branch is a stable compatibility claim.

`sync` and `rollback` preflight every target revision, refuse dirty worktrees,
create `refs/suite/backups/<timestamp>/<repository>` refs, and apply in
provider/dependency order only after explicit confirmation. Submodule pins are
part of the snapshot plan. A failure stops without reset/clean/discard and
leaves backup refs for a later explicit recovery command.

## Current change boundary

The coordinator is now fail-closed for the release-critical distinctions that
ORP170 requires:

- GitHub HTTPS and SSH remotes compare by canonical repository identity.
- Every repository declares its fetch remote. A null push pair is an explicit
  fetch-only boundary and reports `push_status: "not-required"`.
- `status` attaches generated-artifact hashes, provenance, and selected-revision
  reachability to every repository and dependency pin.
- Verification commands may declare a controlled environment map. The ShmUI
  freshness check resolves `SDK_ROOT` relative to its isolated check directory.
- `snapshot observe` captures an immutable development inventory only from a
  clean, marked, remote-reachable workspace.
- Candidate creation validates exact acceptance pairs and candidate checks.
  Stable promotion reruns stable checks and changes only the stable channel
  pointer and top-level release channel; the candidate object is not rewritten.
- All apply paths require an explicit `.orpheus-suite-workspace` marker and
  inspect the repository status before each Git mutation.

ShmUI remains fetch-only in the manifest; its owner must publish any source
change. FourTrack's configured push remote is `origin`, matching the checkout.
Source/package overrides remain manual qualification work and are never guessed
or rewritten by `update`, `sync`, or `coordinate`.

Organization-level decisions remain open: GitHub App installation and
least-privilege repository permissions, CODEOWNERS teams/rulesets, native macOS
runner availability, and the first public suite version/tag. The code does not
invent credentials or claim unavailable native acceptance evidence.
