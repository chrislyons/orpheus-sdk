‚è∫ Perfect! The sprint document (OCC041) with the professional transport bar design phase, along with the
  launch script, have been successfully pushed to GitHub.

‚è∫ Sprint Documentation Complete

  I've successfully completed the requested work:

  What Was Delivered

  1. OCC041 Sprint Document (apps/clip-composer/docs/OCC/OCC041.md)
    - Comprehensive analysis of 6 critical bugs in Edit Dialog v0.2.2-alpha
    - 6 execution phases with detailed technical specifications
    - Phase 6 - Professional Transport Bar Design with:
        - Icon specifications (Play ‚ñ∂, Stop ‚ñ†, Loop üîÅ)
      - Two implementation approaches (DrawableButton vs Custom Component)
      - Visual enhancements (hover effects, press animations, position scrubber)
      - Design references from LOOKBOOK folder (SpotOn, Pro Tools)
    - Skills Framework Integration (rt.safety.auditor, test.result.analyzer, orpheus.doc.gen)
    - Complete testing protocol with acceptance criteria
    - Estimated effort: 6-9 hours
  2. Launch Script (apps/clip-composer/launch.sh)
    - Convenient launcher to eliminate manual app launching
    - Auto-detects build type (debug/release)
    - Manages process lifecycle (kill existing, verify launch)
    - Centralized logging to /tmp/occ.log
  3. All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (branch: phase-3-complete)

  Trigger Phrase

  Execute the sprint with:

  Execute Edit Dialog sprint

  This will autonomously fix all 6 bugs and create the professional transport bar, leveraging the repo's
  skills framework for real-time safety validation, test analysis, and documentation generation.
