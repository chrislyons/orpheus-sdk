## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Comprehensive Scope:** Covering ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md in one task ensured consistency
2. **Link Verification:** Checking all documentation links prevented broken references
3. **Real Examples:** Using OCC v0.2.0-alpha metrics and code examples made docs concrete
4. **Mermaid Diagrams:** Visual architecture diagrams significantly improved clarity

### Challenges Encountered

1. **File Path Discovery:** ORP068 document was in `docs/ORP/` not `docs/integration/` (required fix)
2. **Scope Creep:** Temptation to add more content (resisted, stayed focused on Task 2.4 requirements)
3. **Link Format:** Spaces in filenames required URL encoding in markdown links

### Improvements for Future Documentation Work

1. **Documentation Index:** Create `docs/INDEX.md` with all documentation paths
2. **Link Checker Script:** Automate link validation (`scripts/check-docs-links.sh`)
3. **Documentation Coverage Report:** Track % of APIs with Doxygen comments
4. **Visual Diagrams:** Generate more Mermaid diagrams for complex systems (routing matrix, driver architecture)
