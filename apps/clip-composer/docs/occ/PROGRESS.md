## SDK Enhancement Requirements

### Current SDK Capabilities (v0.2.0)

**What SDK Has:**

- ✅ SessionGraph (tracks, clips, tempo, transport state)
- ✅ Offline rendering (deterministic WAV export)
- ✅ ABI versioning system
- ✅ JSON session serialization
- ✅ GoogleTest suite with sanitizers
- ✅ Cross-platform CI (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**What SDK Lacks:**

- ❌ Real-time playback engine
- ❌ Platform audio drivers (CoreAudio, ASIO, WASAPI)
- ❌ Multi-channel audio routing
- ❌ Audio file I/O abstraction
- ❌ Performance monitoring/diagnostics
- ❌ Input audio graphs (for recording)

**Assessment:** SDK is **60% ready** for OCC MVP. Strong foundation, but missing real-time infrastructure.

### 5 Critical Modules Required

**Module 1: Real-Time Transport Controller** (Months 1-2)

- Purpose: Sample-accurate clip playback with start/stop control
- Interface: `ITransportController` (matching OCC027)
- Key Features: Lock-free audio thread, command queue, callbacks
- Testing: ±1 sample accuracy, 16 simultaneous clips

**Module 2: Audio File Reader Abstraction** (Months 1-2)

- Purpose: Decode audio files and stream to playback buffers
- Interface: `IAudioFileReader` (matching OCC027)
- Library: libsndfile (LGPL, mature, cross-platform)
- Key Features: Ring buffers, sample rate conversion, integrity verification

**Module 3: Multi-Channel Routing Matrix** (Months 3-4)

- Purpose: Route audio from clips → Clip Groups → Master Output
- Interface: `IRoutingMatrix` (matching OCC027)
- Key Features: 4 Clip Groups, gain smoothing, real-time control
- Testing: No clicks/pops on gain changes, CPU <30% with 16 clips

**Module 4: Platform Audio Driver Integration** (Months 1-2)

- Purpose: Low-latency audio I/O on macOS/Windows
- Interface: `IAudioDriver` (matching OCC027)
- Drivers: CoreAudio (macOS), WASAPI (Windows), ASIO (optional)
- Testing: Latency <5ms (ASIO), <10ms (WASAPI/CoreAudio)

**Module 5: Performance Monitor** (Months 4-5)

- Purpose: Real-time diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Interface: `IPerformanceMonitor` (matching OCC027)
- Key Features: CPU tracking, underrun detection, latency reporting
- Testing: Thread-safe queries, minimal overhead (<0.5% CPU)

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Audio I/O + Transport Foundation** (Months 1-2)

- Implement CoreAudio and WASAPI drivers
- Implement audio file reader (libsndfile)
- Create basic transport controller (single-clip playback)
- Write unit tests for each module

**Phase 2: Routing + Multi-Clip** (Months 3-4)

- Implement routing matrix with 4 Clip Groups
- Extend transport for multi-clip playback (16 simultaneous)
- Add callback system for transport events
- Integration tests

**Phase 3: Diagnostics + Polish** (Months 5-6)

- Implement performance monitor
- ASIO driver support (Windows professional)
- CPU optimization (<30% target with 16 clips)
- Cross-platform validation

**Critical Path:** SDK Months 1-4 must complete on schedule to avoid blocking OCC development.

### Parallel Development Strategy

**Enables:**

- OCC team starts UI work immediately (Month 1) using stub implementations
- SDK team builds real modules in parallel
- Integration in Month 3 (no blocking dependencies)
- Risk reduction: Both teams can proceed independently

**Coordination:**

- Weekly sync meetings (SDK + OCC teams)
- Shared integration test suite (SDK provides, OCC runs)
- Continuous communication (GitHub issues, Slack)

### Product Decisions (Non-Blocking)

1. **Pricing Model:** One-time purchase vs subscription?
   - **Impact:** Business model, revenue projections
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Month 3 (pre-beta)

2. **Open-Source Strategy:** Fully open vs dual-license?
   - **Impact:** Community growth, competitive advantage
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Month 3 (pre-beta)

3. **Enterprise Features:** Separate SKU vs modular?
   - **Impact:** Product positioning, development scope
   - **Timeline:** Decide by v1.0 planning (Month 7)

4. **Launch Platform:** macOS, Windows, or both simultaneously?
   - **Recommendation:** Windows first (larger broadcast market)
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Month 1 (affects development priorities)

### Technical Decisions (SDK Team)

5. **Fade Management:** SDK or OCC handles clip fades?
   - **Recommendation:** SDK handles (consistency across apps)
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Week 1 (affects Module 1 design)

6. **Aux Sends in MVP:** Include or defer to v1.0?
   - **Recommendation:** Defer (simplify routing matrix)
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Month 2 (before Module 3)

7. **Network Streaming:** Support HTTP audio files?
   - **Recommendation:** Defer to v2.0 (local files only for MVP)
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Month 1 (affects Module 2 design)

8. **Real-Time Modules Optional:** CMake flag or always built?
   - **Recommendation:** Optional (allows offline-only builds)
   - **Timeline:** Decide by Week 1 (affects CMake structure)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

**SDK Team:**

1. ✅ Review OCC029 recommendations, approve architecture
2. ✅ Create GitHub issues for 5 core modules
3. ✅ Set up project board (Kanban: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
4. ✅ Install dependencies (libsndfile, ASIO SDK)
5. ✅ Create feature branches

**OCC Team:**

1. ✅ Review OCC027 API contracts
2. ✅ Set up JUCE project with stub SDK integration
3. ✅ Create mock implementations of 5 interfaces
4. ✅ Begin UI layout (clip grid, bottom panel)

**Both Teams:**

1. ✅ Weekly sync meeting schedule
2. ✅ Shared integration test suite
3. ✅ Communication channels (Slack, GitHub)

### Implementation Phase (Months 1-6)

**Month 1:**

- SDK: Audio drivers + file reader + basic transport
- OCC: JUCE setup + UI layout + stubs

**Month 2:**

- SDK: Multi-clip playback + callbacks
- OCC: Clip triggering + waveform display

**Month 3:**

- SDK: Routing matrix + integration tests
- OCC: Waveform editor + session save/load

**Month 4:**

- SDK: Performance monitor + cross-platform
- OCC: Routing UI + bottom panel

**Month 5:**

- SDK: ASIO driver + optimization
- OCC: Cross-platform polish + auto-save

**Month 6:**

- SDK: Bug fixes + profiling + docs
- OCC: Beta testing + crash reporting
