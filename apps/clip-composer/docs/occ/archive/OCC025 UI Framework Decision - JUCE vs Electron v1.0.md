# OCC025 UI Framework Decision: JUCE vs Electron v1.0

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** Draft (Decision Pending)
**Supersedes:** None

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the two primary UI framework candidates for Orpheus Clip Composer's desktop application:

1. **JUCE** (C++ native framework)
2. **Electron** (web technologies: TypeScript/React)

**Decision Criteria:**

- Performance (latency, CPU usage, memory footprint)
- Development velocity (time to MVP, iteration speed)
- Cross-platform consistency (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Audio integration (real-time threading, driver access)
- Team expertise and long-term maintainability
- Ecosystem and community support

**Recommendation (Preliminary):** JUCE for desktop application, React Native for iOS companion app.

**Rationale:** OCC is an audio-first, real-time application where performance and audio thread safety are non-negotiable. JUCE's native audio integration, proven track record in professional audio software, and deterministic performance make it the safer choice for mission-critical broadcast/theater use.

## 3. Deep Dive: Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Latency Considerations

**JUCE:**

```cpp
// Direct audio callback (real-time thread)
void processBlock(juce::AudioBuffer<float>& buffer, juce::MidiBuffer& midi) {
    // Called directly by CoreAudio/ASIO driver
    // No IPC overhead
    // Typical latency: <1ms from user input to audio output
}

// UI event handling
void buttonClicked(juce::Button* button) {
    // Immediate access to audio engine
    audioEngine.triggerClip(clipUUID);
    // No inter-process communication
}
```

**Electron:**

```javascript
// Main process (Node.js) handles audio via native addon
const audioEngine = require('./native-audio-addon.node');

// Renderer process (UI) must IPC to main process
ipcRenderer.send('trigger-clip', { uuid: 'clip_001' });

// Main process receives IPC message
ipcMain.on('trigger-clip', (event, data) => {
  // 5-15ms latency from UI event to audio callback
  audioEngine.triggerClip(data.uuid);
});
```

**Verdict:** JUCE's direct access to audio thread provides 5-10x lower latency. Critical for broadcast/theater use where <5ms total latency is expected.

### 3.2 CPU Usage

**JUCE:**

- Native rendering (CoreGraphics/GDI+/Cairo)
- Efficient repaints (only invalidated regions)
- OpenGL acceleration available for waveform rendering

**Typical CPU Usage:**

- Idle: 1-2%
- Active (16 clips playing, waveform updates): 10-15%

**Electron:**

- Chromium rendering engine (full browser overhead)
- React reconciliation and re-renders
- GPU acceleration via Chromium (helpful but still overhead)

**Typical CPU Usage:**

- Idle: 5-10%
- Active: 20-30%

**Verdict:** JUCE uses ~50% less CPU. Important for 24/7 operational stability.

### 3.3 Memory Footprint

**JUCE:**

- Minimal runtime (~10 MB framework)
- Application code + assets: ~20-50 MB
- Total: **~50-100 MB**

**Electron:**

- Chromium bundle: ~100 MB
- Node.js runtime: ~20 MB
- Application code + assets: ~30-50 MB
- Total: **~150-300 MB**

**Verdict:** JUCE uses 2-3x less memory. Matters for resource-constrained environments (older hardware, installations).

## 4. Audio Integration Analysis

### 4.1 JUCE: First-Class Audio Support

**Built-in Audio Subsystem:**

```cpp
juce::AudioDeviceManager deviceManager;

// Enumerate audio devices
juce::Array<juce::AudioIODeviceType*> types;
deviceManager.createAudioDeviceTypes(types);

// Select ASIO device on Windows
deviceManager.setCurrentAudioDeviceType("ASIO", true);

// Set buffer size and sample rate
auto* device = deviceManager.getCurrentAudioDevice();
device->setBufferSize(128); // Low-latency

// Register callback
deviceManager.addAudioCallback(this);
```

**Direct Audio Thread Access:**

- `AudioIODevice::audioDeviceIOCallback()` runs on real-time thread
- No marshaling, no copying, no IPC
- Sample-accurate timing guaranteed

**Driver Support:**

- **macOS:** CoreAudio (native)
- **Windows:** ASIO, WASAPI, DirectSound
- **Linux:** ALSA, JACK
- **iOS:** CoreAudio

**Device Aggregation:**

- Built-in support for aggregated devices (macOS)
- Fallback mechanisms (ASIO → WASAPI on Windows)

### 4.2 Electron: Requires Native Add-ons

**Typical Approach:**

```javascript
// Must create C++ addon using N-API or node-addon-api
// Example: using node-portaudio or custom addon

const PortAudio = require('portaudio');

const stream = PortAudio.createWriteStream({
  channelCount: 2,
  sampleFormat: PortAudio.SampleFormat.FLOAT32,
  sampleRate: 48000,
  framesPerBuffer: 256,
});

stream.on('audio', (buffer) => {
  // Fill buffer (runs in Node.js worker thread, NOT audio thread)
  // Must marshal data from main process → audio thread
  // Latency penalty: 5-15ms
});
```

**Challenges:**

- **Native add-ons brittle:** Must recompile for every Electron version
- **IPC overhead:** Renderer → Main → Audio thread (two hops)
- **No built-in ASIO support:** Must integrate manually (complex)
- **Thread safety:** Chromium's IPC not designed for real-time audio

**Workaround: Separate Audio Process:**

- Run audio engine as standalone C++ process
- Electron UI communicates via WebSockets/IPC
- **Problem:** This negates Electron's "single codebase" advantage

---

## 5. Development Velocity

### 5.1 Time to MVP

**JUCE:**

- Initial setup: 1-2 days (CMake, project structure)
- Basic UI components: 2-3 weeks (grid layout, panels, transport)
- Waveform editor: 2-3 weeks (custom rendering)
- Audio integration: 1 week (already built-in)
- **Total MVP estimate:** 8-10 weeks

**Electron:**

- Initial setup: 1 day (npm, webpack, React boilerplate)
- Basic UI components: 1-2 weeks (React components, CSS)
- Waveform editor: 1-2 weeks (Canvas or WebGL library)
- Audio integration: 3-4 weeks (native addon, debugging)
- **Total MVP estimate:** 6-9 weeks

**Verdict:** Electron 20-30% faster for UI-heavy features, but audio integration complexity evens the score.

### 5.2 Iteration Speed

**JUCE:**

- Compile time: 30-90 seconds (incremental builds)
- Full rebuild: 5-10 minutes
- Hot-reload: Not available (must recompile)

**Electron:**

- Compile time: <5 seconds (TypeScript transpilation)
- Full rebuild: 30 seconds
- Hot-reload: Yes (instant UI updates)

**Verdict:** Electron significantly faster for UI iteration. JUCE slower due to C++ compile times.

---

## 6. Cross-Platform Considerations

### 6.1 Platform Parity

**JUCE:**

- Single codebase for Windows, macOS, Linux
- Native look-and-feel OR custom look-and-feel
- Platform-specific quirks: Low (well-abstracted)
- **Consistency:** High

**Electron:**

- Single codebase for all platforms
- Web-based UI (identical on all platforms)
- Platform-specific quirks: Medium (Chromium differences)
- **Consistency:** Very High (CSS ensures pixel-perfect match)

**Verdict:** Both excellent. Electron slight edge for visual consistency.

### 6.2 Platform-Specific Features

**JUCE:**

- Easy to call platform-specific APIs (Objective-C, Win32)
- Native menu bars, dialogs, file pickers

**Electron:**

- Node.js native modules for platform APIs
- Must use IPC for renderer → main process calls

**Verdict:** JUCE simpler for deep platform integration.

- **Why JUCE:** Performance, audio thread safety, cross-platform

**Bitwig Studio:**

- Modern DAW with advanced modulation and MPE support
- **Why JUCE:** Native performance, VST3 hosting, deterministic behavior

**Takeaway:** Every major professional audio application uses JUCE or equivalent (not Electron).

### 8.2 Electron in Audio Space

**Ableton Note:**

- Mobile-first music creation app (iOS/Android)
- Desktop version uses Electron for UI
- **BUT:** Audio engine is separate C++ process (not integrated into Electron)
- **Why Electron:** Rapid development for UI, cross-platform consistency

**Splice Desktop:**

- Sample library and collaboration tool
- Uses Electron for UI
- **BUT:** Playback is basic (no real-time editing, no low-latency requirement)

**Audacity (proposed rewrite):**

- Considered Electron for UI modernization
- **Rejected** due to performance concerns and community backlash
- **Stayed with:** wxWidgets (C++ native framework)

**Takeaway:** Electron suitable for audio tools with basic playback, NOT for real-time, low-latency, professional use.

## 9. Cost Analysis

### 9.1 JUCE Licensing

**Options:**

1. **GPL v3** - Free, but requires open-sourcing OCC
2. **JUCE Indie License** - $40/month (if revenue <$50k/year)
3. **JUCE Pro License** - $800/year (unlimited revenue)
4. **JUCE Educational** - Free for students/educators

**For OCC:**

- If open-source (likely for Orpheus SDK integration): **GPL v3 = Free**
- If proprietary: **JUCE Indie = $480/year** (assuming <$50k revenue initially)

### 9.2 Electron Licensing

**License:** MIT (completely free, no restrictions)

**Hidden Costs:**

- Chromium security updates (must rebase on new Electron versions regularly)
- Native addon maintenance (recompile for each Electron version)

**Verdict:** Electron free upfront, but JUCE's licensing cost is manageable ($480/year for indie).

---

## 10. Risk Analysis

### 10.1 JUCE Risks

**Risk: Vendor Lock-In**

- JUCE owned by PACE Anti-Piracy (acquired 2014)
- **Mitigation:** Large user base, stable company, open-source option (GPL)

**Risk: Learning Curve**

- C++ expertise required
- JUCE API extensive and complex
- **Mitigation:** Excellent documentation, active forum, many examples

**Risk: Slower UI Iteration**

- Compile times slow down rapid prototyping
- **Mitigation:** Use Projucer for live UI preview (limited)

### 10.2 Electron Risks

**Risk: Audio Performance**

- IPC latency unacceptable for real-time audio
- **Mitigation:** Separate audio process (defeats Electron's purpose)

**Risk: Binary Size**

- 100-150 MB installers (3x larger than JUCE)
- **Mitigation:** Users expect large apps in 2025, less critical

**Risk: Frequent Breaking Changes**

- Electron updates often require code changes
- **Mitigation:** Pin Electron version, update strategically

**Risk: Professional Credibility**

- Broadcast/theater users may perceive Electron as "not serious"
- **Mitigation:** Focus on performance in marketing, but perception risk remains

---

## 11. Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds?

### 11.1 Concept: JUCE Audio + Electron UI

**Architecture:**

```
Electron UI (React, fast iteration)
    ↓ (WebSocket/IPC)
JUCE Audio Engine (C++, real-time)
```

**Pros:**

- Rapid UI development (Electron)
- Rock-solid audio (JUCE)
- Independent release cycles (UI can update without audio changes)

**Cons:**

- **Complexity:** Two separate applications to build/maintain
- **Deployment:** Must package and install both components
- **IPC Overhead:** 5-15ms latency (same problem as pure Electron)
- **User Experience:** Risk of de-sync between UI and audio

**Verdict:** Not recommended. Complexity outweighs benefits.

### 11.2 Alternative: JUCE for Desktop, React Native for iOS

**Architecture:**

```
Desktop: JUCE (native performance)
iOS Companion: React Native (rapid cross-platform mobile dev)
```

**Pros:**

- Desktop gets full JUCE performance
- iOS app developed quickly with React Native
- Clear separation of concerns

**Cons:**

- Two different UI frameworks (JUCE + React Native)
- Cannot reuse desktop UI code for iOS
- **Acceptable:** Desktop and mobile apps have different UX requirements anyway

**Verdict:** **RECOMMENDED**. This is the pragmatic choice.

| **iOS Companion App**                 | **React Native**          | Rapid mobile dev, good-enough performance for remote control |
| **Web-Based Remote Control**          | **React + WebSockets**    | Already planned for desktop server, reuse tech stack         |
| **Admin/Config Tools**                | **Electron (optional)**   | If separate non-audio tools needed, Electron acceptable      |

---

## 13. Final Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: JUCE for Desktop Application

**Rationale:**

1. **Performance is Non-Negotiable**
   - Broadcast and theater use cases demand <5ms latency
   - 24/7 reliability requires minimal CPU/memory overhead
   - JUCE's proven track record in professional audio applications

2. **Audio Integration is Critical**
   - Built-in CoreAudio/ASIO/WASAPI support saves months of development
   - Real-time thread safety guaranteed by design
   - Sample-accurate timing for deterministic playback

3. **Professional Credibility**
   - Users expect professional audio tools to be native, not web-based
   - JUCE's pedigree (Ableton, iZotope, Bitwig) provides market confidence

4. **Long-Term Stability**
   - Mature API (20+ years of development)
   - Stable licensing (GPL or commercial)
   - Large community of audio developers

5. **Acceptable Trade-offs**
   - Slower UI iteration offset by correctness-first approach
   - Learning curve acceptable given long-term stability
   - Licensing cost ($480/year indie) is negligible

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**"Electron enables faster MVP"**

- True for UI, but audio integration complexity evens out timeline
- OCC is an audio-first application—UI is secondary concern

**"Electron has larger ecosystem"**

- Irrelevant for audio-specific needs (JUCE's niche is our niche)
- We're not building a general-purpose app

**"Electron is free"**

- JUCE GPL option is also free (if open-sourcing OCC)
- Indie license ($480/year) is trivial compared to development costs

### Secondary Recommendation: React Native for iOS Companion

**Rationale:**

- iOS app is remote control only (no real-time audio processing on device)
- React Native enables rapid iteration and cross-platform potential (Android later)
- Separate codebase acceptable (mobile UX differs from desktop anyway)
