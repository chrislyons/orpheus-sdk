## 6. Recommendation Analysis

### 6.1 Primary Recommendation: Rubber Band Library

**Why Rubber Band:**

1. **Best Audio Quality**
   - Professional broadcast requires minimal artifacts
   - Theater sound designers demand natural vocal pitch-shifting
   - Transient preservation critical for percussive sounds

2. **Industry Validation**
   - Used by Ardour (professional DAW)
   - Used by Audacity (most popular open-source audio editor)
   - Used by Mixxx (professional DJ software)
   - If it's good enough for these, it's good enough for OCC

3. **Real-Time Performance Acceptable**
   - R3 mode handles 4-8 simultaneous clips on modern hardware
   - OCC026 MVP targets 16 simultaneous clips, but time-stretching is v1.0 feature (users can upgrade hardware by then)
   - Faster mode available if CPU becomes bottleneck

4. **Licensing Cost Manageable**
   - $50/year for indie (<$50k revenue) is negligible
   - Can use AGPL if OCC goes fully open-source
   - Evaluation license available for development

5. **Long-Term Support**
   - 17+ years of active development
   - Responsive maintainer
   - Clear roadmap for future improvements

**When to Choose Rubber Band:**

- **Professional broadcast** (quality non-negotiable)
- **Theater sound design** (natural vocal adjustments required)
- **Live performance** (real-time tempo sync with quality)

### 6.2 Alternative Recommendation: SoundTouch

**Why SoundTouch:**

1. **Free (LGPL)**
   - Zero licensing cost
   - No open-source requirement for OCC
   - Perfect for budget-constrained users

2. **Better Performance**
   - Lower CPU usage (2x improvement over Rubber Band)
   - Can handle 10-16 simultaneous stretched clips
   - Better for older hardware

3. **Good Enough Quality**
   - Most users won't notice the difference for moderate adjustments
   - Acceptable for non-critical broadcast work
   - Fine for most theater cues

4. **Mature & Stable**
   - 23+ years of development
   - No major bugs reported
   - Proven in production

**When to Choose SoundTouch:**

- **No pitch-shifting** - Critical feature for OCC
- **Limited use cases** - Only suitable for voiceovers, not sound effects or music

**Sonic is off the table for OCC.**

---

## 7. Implementation Strategy

### 7.1 Recommended Approach: Pluggable DSP Architecture

**Don't hard-code a single library.** Design Orpheus SDK with a pluggable DSP interface:

```cpp
// Orpheus SDK: IDSPProcessor interface (from OCC027 future interfaces)
namespace orpheus::sdk {

class IDSPProcessor {
public:
    virtual ~IDSPProcessor() = default;

    virtual void setTimeRatio(float ratio) = 0;      // 0.5 to 3.0
    virtual void setPitchShift(float semitones) = 0; // -12 to +12

    virtual void process(const AudioBuffer& input, AudioBuffer& output) = 0;
    virtual void reset() = 0;
};

// Factory for creating DSP processors
enum class DSPLibrary { RubberBand, SoundTouch };

std::unique_ptr<IDSPProcessor> createDSPProcessor(
    DSPLibrary library,
    uint32_t sampleRate,
    uint8_t channels
);

} // namespace orpheus::sdk
```

**Benefits:**

- OCC can switch libraries at runtime (user preference)
- Can offer "High Quality" (Rubber Band) vs "Fast" (SoundTouch) modes
- Future-proof (add new libraries without breaking OCC)
- A/B testing (compare libraries side-by-side)

### 7.2 OCC Configuration (v1.0)

```json
// OCC Preferences: DSP Settings
{
  "dsp": {
    "time_stretch_library": "RubberBand", // or "SoundTouch"
    "quality_mode": "HighQuality", // or "RealTime", "Fast"
    "max_simultaneous_dsp_clips": 8
  }
}
```

**User-facing options:**

- **DSP Library:** "Best Quality (Rubber Band)" vs "Best Performance (SoundTouch)"
- **Quality Mode:** "High Quality" vs "Real-Time" vs "Fast"

### 7.3 Licensing Strategy

**If OCC is open-source (MIT/GPL):**

- Use Rubber Band AGPL (free)
- Distribute source code (already required by MIT/GPL)

**If OCC is proprietary:**

- Purchase Rubber Band commercial license ($50-500/year)
- Budget $500/year for licensing (affordable)

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**

- **Orpheus SDK:** MIT license (open-source)
- **OCC Application:** Proprietary (paid or free binary distribution)
- **Rubber Band:** Commercial license for OCC
- **User benefit:** Users can choose SoundTouch (free) in preferences if they prefer

### Appendix B: Code Examples

**Rubber Band Integration:**

```cpp
// OCC/DSP/RubberBandProcessor.cpp
class RubberBandProcessor : public IDSPProcessor {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<RubberBand::RubberBandStretcher> stretcher;

public:
    RubberBandProcessor(uint32_t sampleRate, uint8_t channels) {
        stretcher = std::make_unique<RubberBand::RubberBandStretcher>(
            sampleRate, channels,
            RubberBand::RubberBandStretcher::OptionProcessRealTime
        );
    }

    void setTimeRatio(float ratio) override {
        stretcher->setTimeRatio(ratio);
    }

    void setPitchShift(float semitones) override {
        float scale = std::pow(2.0f, semitones / 12.0f);
        stretcher->setPitchScale(scale);
    }

    void process(const AudioBuffer& input, AudioBuffer& output) override {
        stretcher->process(input.samples, input.frameCount, false);
        int available = stretcher->available();
        stretcher->retrieve(output.samples, available);
        output.frameCount = available;
    }
};
