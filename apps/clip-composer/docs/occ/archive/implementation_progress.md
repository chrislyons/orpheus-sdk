# Clip Composer - Implementation Progress

**Project:** Orpheus Clip Composer (OCC)
**Location:** `/apps/clip-composer/`
**Status:** v0.1.0-alpha Released! Phase 3 Complete
**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025

---

## Current Status: v0.1.0-alpha Released ✅

**Release:** https://github.com/chrislyons/orpheus-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha
**Binary:** OrpheusClipComposer-v0.1.0-arm64.dmg (36MB)
**Platform:** macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon only)
**Build Type:** Debug (Release optimization pending)

### What's Working

✅ **Core Functionality**

- 48-button clip grid (6×8) with 8 tabs = 384 total clips
- Real-time audio playback via CoreAudio
- Drag & drop audio file loading (WAV, AIFF, FLAC)
- Keyboard shortcuts for all 48 buttons (QWERTY layout)
- Session save/load (JSON format with full metadata)
- Transport controls (Stop All, Panic)

✅ **Clip Editing** (Double-click any loaded clip)

- Phase 1: Name, color, clip group assignment
- Phase 2: Waveform visualization with real-time trim markers
- Phase 3: Fade In/Out times (0.0-3.0s) with curve selection

✅ **UI Polish**

- Inter typeface throughout
- 20% larger fonts
- 3-line text wrapping for clip names
- Prominent time display (total + remaining during playback)
- Drag-to-reorder clips (240ms hold time)
- Stop Others On Play mode (per-clip solo)

### Known Limitations

⚠️ **Build**

- Debug build only (Release has linker issues to fix)
- Apple Silicon only (no Intel or universal binary yet)
- Sample rate locked to 48kHz (auto-conversion coming)

⚠️ **Features**

- Trim handles not interactive (slider-based only)
- Fade curves stored but not applied during playback
- No recording (v1.0 feature)

## Next Phase: v0.2.0 Planning

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Release Build** - Resolve linker issues for optimized binary
2. **Wire Fade Curves to AudioEngine** - Apply fade curves during playback
3. **Interactive Trim Handles** - Drag handles on waveform to adjust trim points
4. **Universal Binary** - Build for Intel + ARM (requires universal dependencies)

### v0.2.0 Feature Targets

- Optimized Release build (smaller, faster)
- Fade curves active during playback
- Interactive waveform editing
- Sample rate auto-conversion (48kHz engine, any file format)
- Beta testing with 5-10 broadcast/theater users
- Bug fixes from alpha feedback

### v1.0.0 Roadmap (6 months from Oct 2025)

- Recording support
- Time-stretching (Rubber Band integration)
- VST3/AU plugin hosting
- Remote control via OSC (iOS companion app)
- Performance monitoring UI (CPU meter, latency display)
- Advanced routing (4 clip groups → master)
- Waveform caching (instant dialog open)

---

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority

1. **Release build linker errors** - Missing symbols, needs investigation
2. **Fade curves not applied** - Stored in metadata but not wired to AudioEngine
3. **Sample rate hardcoded** - 48kHz only, no auto-conversion
4. **Waveform not cached** - Regenerated on each dialog open

### Medium Priority

5. **Trim handles not interactive** - Slider-based only, drag handles TODO
6. **No stereo waveform** - Mono mix only, separate L/R channels TODO
7. **No waveform zoom** - Fixed resolution tied to component width
8. **Debug assertions in JUCE** - String.cpp warnings (cosmetic, JUCE issue)

### Low Priority

9. **No waveform overlay on active clips** - Performance-gated (v1.0 feature)
10. **No fade curve visualization** - Just numeric settings (Phase 3 enhancement)
11. **No beat snapping** - Fade times not quantized to bars/beats (v1.0 feature)
12. **No crossfade preview** - Stop Others mode doesn't visualize overlap (v1.0 feature)
