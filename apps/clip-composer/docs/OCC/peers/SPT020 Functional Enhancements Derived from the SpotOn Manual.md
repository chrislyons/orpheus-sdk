    - This could be an opt‑in module that, when enabled, allows the user to assign physical GPI inputs to specific clip triggers.
2. **Configurable GPI Assignments:**
    - Allow users to configure GPI channels to specific clip buttons, similar to SpotOn’s approach. Include options to enable or disable GPI triggers and to re-scan for connected devices.
    - Provide settings for debounce time and auto‑arming of timecode-based triggers to prevent false triggering.
3. **GPI Emulation Options:**
    - Consider supporting GPI emulation via alternative sources (e.g., MIDI timecode or system clock triggers) to serve as a fallback when physical GPI hardware is not available.
    - This adds flexibility and ensures external control remains robust even in mixed hardware environments.
4. **Visual Feedback and Diagnostics:**
    - Integrate a dedicated section in the UI (or status bar) that provides real‑time visual feedback for GPI activity, including status indicators for active/inactive channels and error notifications.
    - Ensure that any GPI event (whether physical or emulated) is logged and that diagnostic information is available for troubleshooting.




## IV. Conclusion

Incorporating optional GPI functionality into our soundboard application can enhance external control flexibility—especially for users with legacy or specialized hardware setups. Drawing on SpotOn’s approach, we recommend implementing configurable GPI assignments, support for GPI emulation, and real‑time visual feedback to enable seamless, reliable triggering of cues.
