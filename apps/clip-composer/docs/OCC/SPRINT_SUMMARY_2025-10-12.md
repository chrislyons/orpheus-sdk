- Success metrics overview

### 2. Core Design Specifications

✅ **[OCC022 - Clip Metadata Schema v1.0](OCC022%20Clip%20Metadata%20Schema%20v1.0.md)**
- Complete JSON schema for individual audio clips
- 8 major sections: Identity, Audio Reference, Edit Points, Fades, DSP, Playback, Linking, UI, Recording, Statistics

- SpotOn-inspired features (AutoTrim, master/slave linking, AutoPlay)
- Orpheus SDK integration points identified
- Validation rules and error recovery strategies
- 450+ lines, production-ready specification

**Key Innovations:**
- File hash for intelligent recovery when paths break
- Master/slave linking for coordinated cue sequences
- Direct recording metadata (LTC timecode, operator, input source)
- Waveform cache for performance optimization

✅ **[OCC023 - Component Architecture v1.0](OCC023%20Component%20Architecture%20v1.0.md)**
- Complete system architecture with layer separation
- 5 architectural layers: UI, Application Logic, SDK Integration, SDK Core, Platform Drivers
- Component descriptions for 10+ major modules
- Threading model (UI, Audio, Background I/O, Network, Recording threads)
- Data flow diagrams for key operations (clip trigger, recording, session load)
- Dependency graph and build flags
- Security, error handling, and testing strategies
- 650+ lines, comprehensive system design

**Key Insights:**
- OCC is full-featured application, not thin adapter
- Lock-free audio thread communication (no mutexes in hot path)
- Modular SDK integration via adapter pattern
- Platform-specific components clearly separated

✅ **[OCC024 - User Interaction Flows v1.0](OCC024%20User%20Interaction%20Flows%20v1.0.md)**
- 8 complete user workflows with step-by-step details
- Covers all 4 user personas (Broadcast, Theater, Installation, Live Performance)
- Success criteria and error paths for each flow
- Visual feedback and keyboard shortcut specifications
- SpotOn-inspired interaction patterns
- 550+ lines, production UX specification

**Workflows Documented:**
1. Loading a clip into a button (with track preview)
2. Editing trim points with sample accuracy
3. Recording directly into a button
4. Configuring audio routing
5. Master/slave linking for coordinated cues
6. Creating a new session
7. Using iOS companion app for remote control
8. Session recovery after missing files

✅ **[OCC025 - UI Framework Decision v1.0](OCC025%20UI%20Framework%20Decision%20-%20JUCE%20vs%20Electron%20v1.0.md)**

- 13-criteria comparison matrix
- Deep dive on performance, latency, audio integration
- Real-world case studies (iZotope RX, Ableton Note, Tracktion)
- Cost analysis and risk assessment
- Implementation roadmap for chosen framework
- 700+ lines, executive decision-ready

**Recommendation:**
- **Primary:** JUCE for desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **Secondary:** React Native for iOS companion app
- **Rationale:** Audio-first application requires native performance, <5ms latency, professional credibility

## Key Insights from Competitive Analysis

### SpotOn (Primary Inspiration)
From **[SPT023](peers/SPT023%20Comprehensive%20SpotOn%20Report_%20Functional%20Enhancements%20&%20Workflow%20Insights.md)**:
- ✅ Track preview with dedicated transport controls (incorporated in OCC024 Flow 1)
- ✅ AutoTrim function with configurable dB threshold (incorporated in OCC022)
- ✅ Master/slave linking for coordinated playback (incorporated in OCC022 + OCC024 Flow 5)
- ✅ AutoPlay/jukebox mode for continuous playout (incorporated in OCC022)
- ✅ Rehearsal features and "Play to In" (incorporated in OCC024 Flow 2)
- ❓ GPI external triggering (optional, v2.0 feature)

**Market Position:** SpotOn costs €3,000-5,000 but has dated UI. OCC targets €500-1,500 with modern interface.

### Ovation (Enterprise Reference)
From **[MOV001](peers/MOV001%20Merging%20Ovation%20Media%20Server.md)**:
- ✅ Interaction rules engine concept (noted for v2.0 consideration)
- ✅ Multi-sequencer synchronization (iOS app coordination)
- ✅ 24/7 reliability requirements (incorporated into architecture)
- ✅ Professional audio quality focus (JUCE recommendation supports this)
- ❌ MassCore technology (out of scope - too expensive/complex)

**Market Position:** Ovation costs €8,000-25,000+ for enterprise. OCC targets accessible professional market.

## Design Decisions Made

### Confirmed
1. **Data Format:** JSON for session files (human-readable, portable, extensible)
2. **Metadata Model:** Sample-accurate (samples authoritative, seconds derived)
3. **Architectural Pattern:** Clear separation of SDK core, adapters, and application logic
4. **Threading Model:** Lock-free audio thread, separate UI/I/O/Network/Recording threads
5. **File Recovery:** Hash-based intelligent search for relocated files

### Pending (Critical Path)
1. **UI Framework:** JUCE vs Electron - Analysis complete (OCC025), awaiting final decision by Nov 1, 2025
   - **Recommendation:** JUCE (rationale: performance, audio integration, professional credibility)

### Deferred (v2.0+)
1. **DSP Library:** Rubber Band vs SoundTouch vs Sonic (defer to implementation phase)
2. **Plugin Architecture:** VST3 only vs AU/LV2 (v2.0 decision)
3. **Pricing Model:** One-time vs Subscription (user research needed)

## Alignment with OCC021 Product Vision

All new documents (OCC022-025) align with OCC021's core principles:

✅ **Reliability Above All**
- Component architecture specifies crash-proof design (OCC023)
- Auto-save and intelligent file recovery (OCC024)
- 24/7 operational stability targets (OCC025 performance analysis)

✅ **Performance-First Architecture**
- Sample-accurate timing throughout (OCC022 schema)
- Lock-free audio thread (OCC023 threading model)
- <5ms latency requirement (OCC025 JUCE analysis)

✅ **User Experience Excellence**
- Established mouse logic (OCC024 interaction flows)
- Keyboard shortcuts for all operations (OCC024 summary)
- Progressive disclosure (OCC023 UI layer design)

✅ **Sovereign Ecosystem**
- Local-first design (OCC023 security section)
- No cloud dependencies (optional features only)
- Human-readable data formats (OCC022 JSON schema)

---

## Orpheus SDK Integration Points Identified

**What OCC Needs from SDK:**
- `SessionGraph` - Hold clip references, tempo, transport state
- `TransportController` - Sample-accurate playback control
- `RoutingMatrix` - Multi-channel flexible routing
- `AudioFileReader` - Multi-format decoding abstraction
- `PerformanceMonitor` - Real-time diagnostics
- **Real-time playback mode** (not just offline rendering)
- **Input audio graphs** (for recording, not just playback)
- **Clip grid scheduler** (soundboard-specific logic)
- **Plugin architecture** (DSP, codecs, protocols)

**What OCC Drives in SDK Evolution:**
1. Real-time I/O adapters (CoreAudio, ASIO, WASAPI)
2. Recording input graphs
3. Network protocol abstractions (WebSocket, OSC)
4. Session metadata extensions

**Boundary Maintained:**
- OCC is APPLICATION, not thin adapter (per AGENTS.md principles)
- SDK remains host-neutral and minimal
- Clear adapter layer translates OCC concepts to SDK primitives

   - UX review: User flows completeness
   - Product review: Alignment with vision

2. **Finalize UI framework decision** (deadline: Nov 1, 2025)
   - Build JUCE proof-of-concept (1 week)
   - Evaluate performance and developer experience
   - Make go/no-go decision

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **Create OCC026 - Milestone 1 Definition**
   - Specific deliverables for MVP (first 6 months)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Success metrics
   - Resource requirements

4. **Create OCC027 - API Contracts**

   - Error handling contracts

5. **Resolve remaining technical decisions**
   - DSP library selection (Rubber Band vs SoundTouch)
   - Session format details (binary optional sidecar)

### Medium-Term (Next Month)
6. **Begin implementation planning**
   - Sprint structure (2-week sprints recommended)
   - Team composition (SDK vs OCC work split)
   - Development environment setup

7. **Create high-fidelity mockups**
   - Figma/Sketch designs based on OCC011 wireframes
   - Visual design system (colors, typography, iconography)
   - Accessibility considerations

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: UI Framework Decision Delay
**Impact:** Delays MVP timeline
**Mitigation:** Hard deadline Nov 1, 2025. If undecided, default to JUCE (lower risk).

### Risk: Orpheus SDK Not Ready
**Impact:** OCC development blocked
**Mitigation:** Identify minimum SDK requirements now (OCC027 API contracts). Stub SDK interfaces for parallel development.

### Risk: Over-Engineering
**Impact:** MVP delayed by feature creep
**Mitigation:** Ruthless prioritization. Defer v2.0 features (GPI, interaction rules, VST3). Focus on core workflows.

### Risk: Competitive Pressure
**Impact:** SpotOn or QLab release major updates
**Mitigation:** Monitor competitors quarterly. Focus on differentiation (cross-platform, modern UI, open architecture).
