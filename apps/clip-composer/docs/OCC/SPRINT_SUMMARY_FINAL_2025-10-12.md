## Document Highlights

### OCC026 - Milestone 1 MVP Definition

**Purpose:** 6-month plan to deliver functional soundboard for beta testing

**Key Sections:**
- **Feature Scope:** MUST HAVE vs deferred (v1.0, v2.0)
- **User Stories:** Primary (Broadcast Engineer) and Secondary (Theater Sound Designer)
- **Performance Targets:** Latency <5ms ASIO, CPU <30% with 16 clips
- **Development Phases:** Month-by-month breakdown
  - Month 1: Foundation & Audio Engine
  - Month 2: Clip Grid & Basic Playback
  - Month 3: Waveform Editor & Editing
  - Month 4: Session Management & Routing
  - Month 5: Cross-Platform Polish
  - Month 6: Beta Testing & Bug Fixing
- **Resource Requirements:** Team composition, infrastructure, licensing costs
- **Success Metrics:** Technical, user experience, market adoption targets

**Critical Decisions:**
- Linux support deferred to v1.0 (macOS + Windows only for MVP)
- Recording, iOS app, master/slave linking, DSP all deferred to v1.0
- Focus on core playback, editing, and session management

**Beta Goal:** 10 users (5 broadcast, 5 theater) testing for 2 weeks

### OCC027 - API Contracts (OCC ↔ SDK Interfaces)

**Purpose:** Define precise C++ interfaces enabling parallel development

**5 Core Interfaces Specified:**
1. **ISessionGraph** - Manage clips, tracks, tempo
2. **ITransportController** - Playback control, sample-accurate timing
3. **IRoutingMatrix** - Multi-channel audio routing
4. **IAudioFileReader** - Decode WAV/AIFF/FLAC
5. **IPerformanceMonitor** - Real-time diagnostics (CPU, latency, dropouts)

**Key Features:**
- Complete C++ header definitions (~250 lines of interface code)
- Usage examples from OCC perspective
- Thread safety guarantees (UI vs audio thread boundaries)
- Error handling contracts (Result<T> pattern)
- Stub implementation guide for parallel development
- Version negotiation and ABI stability strategy

**Strategic Value:**
- OCC team can build against stubs while SDK team implements real engine
- Clear separation of concerns (OCC = application, SDK = audio engine)
- Future-proof (v1.0+ interfaces defined but not implemented yet)

### OCC028 - DSP Library Evaluation

**Purpose:** Choose time-stretch/pitch-shift library for v1.0

**Three Libraries Evaluated:**
1. **Rubber Band Library** (AGPL/Commercial) - Score: 8.7/10
2. **SoundTouch** (LGPL) - Score: 8.1/10
3. **Sonic** (Apache 2.0) - Score: 7.4/10 (rejected)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Audio Quality (40% weight) - Rubber Band wins
- Performance (25%) - SoundTouch wins (lower CPU)
- License (15%) - SoundTouch free, Rubber Band $50-500/year
- API & Integration (10%) - Tie
- Maintenance & Support (10%) - Rubber Band wins

**Recommendation:** **Rubber Band Library** with commercial license
- **Primary:** Rubber Band ($50/year indie, $500/year standard)
- **Alternative:** SoundTouch (free fallback for budget users)
- **Architecture:** Pluggable IDSPProcessor interface (user can choose)

**Cost-Benefit:** $500/year license negligible vs development costs, best-in-class quality worth it.

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Sigma SpotOn (Primary Competitor)

**OCC Advantages:**
- ✅ Modern UI (vs dated late-1990s SpotOn interface)
- ✅ Cross-platform (macOS + Windows vs Windows-only)
- ✅ Open architecture (vs proprietary lock-in)
- ✅ Lower cost (€500-1,500 vs €3,000-5,000)
- ✅ iOS companion app (SpotOn has none)

**SpotOn Advantages:**
- ⚠️ Mature (20+ years in market)
- ⚠️ Proven reliability (thousands of broadcast installations)

**Strategy:** Target smaller studios and theater users first, build reputation, then approach broadcast market.

### vs. QLab (Secondary Competitor)

**OCC Advantages:**
- ✅ Windows support (QLab is macOS-only)
- ✅ Built-in recording (QLab requires external tools)
- ✅ Professional driver support (ASIO for Windows)
- ✅ No channel limitations (QLab caps at 128 channels)

**QLab Advantages:**
- ⚠️ Free tier (vs OCC paid model)
- ⚠️ Established theater market presence

**Strategy:** Windows market is completely underserved by QLab. Focus there.

### vs. Merging Ovation (Tertiary Competitor)

**OCC Advantages:**
- ✅ Accessible pricing (€500-1,500 vs €8,000-25,000+)
- ✅ Simpler learning curve (grid-based vs complex rules engine)
- ✅ No specialized hardware required (vs MassCore)
- ✅ Faster deployment (hours vs days/weeks)

**Ovation Advantages:**
- ⚠️ Enterprise scale (384 channels, multi-room sync)
- ⚠️ Complex interaction rules
- ⚠️ MassCore performance

**Strategy:** Target 90% of use cases (small/mid-size venues). Ovation keeps top 10% (theme parks, Dubai Expo-level).

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items & Status

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Orpheus SDK not ready** | High | Medium | Stub interfaces (OCC027) | ✅ Mitigated |
| **JUCE learning curve** | Medium | Medium | 2-week training allocation | ⚠️ Monitor |
| **Performance targets missed** | High | Low | Early profiling (Month 2) | ⏳ Pending MVP |
| **ASIO driver issues** | High | Low | Multiple interface testing, WASAPI fallback | ⏳ Pending MVP |

**Key Mitigation: Parallel Development**
- OCC027 stub implementations allow OCC development without waiting for SDK
- Reduces critical path dependency
- Enables 6-month MVP timeline even if SDK delays occur

## Key Quotes from Design Documents

### On Architecture (OCC023)
> "OCC is a full-featured application that uses Orpheus SDK as its audio engine, not a thin wrapper around SDK functionality."

### On Performance (OCC026)
> "Audio latency: <5ms (ASIO), <10ms (WASAPI). Mean time between crashes: >100 hours continuous operation. These are non-negotiable requirements for professional broadcast use."

### On Quality (OCC028)
> "Every major professional audio application uses JUCE or equivalent (not Electron). OCC is an audio-first, real-time application where performance and audio thread safety are non-negotiable."

### On Strategy (OCC025)
> "JUCE's proven track record in professional audio applications (iZotope RX, Ableton Live, Tracktion) provides market credibility. Users expect professional audio tools to be native, not web-based."
