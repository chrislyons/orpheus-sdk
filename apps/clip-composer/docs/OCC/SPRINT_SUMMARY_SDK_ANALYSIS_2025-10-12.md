- ❌ Missing real-time infrastructure: playback engine, routing, audio drivers, I/O

**5 Critical Modules Required:**

1. **Real-Time Transport Controller** (Months 1-2)
   - Sample-accurate clip playback with start/stop control
   - Lock-free audio thread with command queue
   - Transport callbacks (clip started/stopped/looped)
   - Interface: `ITransportController` (matching OCC027)

2. **Audio File Reader Abstraction** (Months 1-2)
   - Decode WAV/AIFF/FLAC using libsndfile
   - Stream audio data into ring buffers (non-blocking)
   - Sample rate conversion, file integrity verification
   - Interface: `IAudioFileReader` (matching OCC027)

3. **Multi-Channel Routing Matrix** (Months 3-4)
   - 4 Clip Groups with independent output busses
   - Master output bus, per-clip/per-group routing
   - Real-time gain adjustment with click-free smoothing
   - Interface: `IRoutingMatrix` (matching OCC027)

4. **Platform Audio Driver Integration** (Months 1-2)
   - CoreAudio (macOS), ASIO (Windows pro), WASAPI (Windows consumer)
   - Low-latency I/O (<5ms ASIO, <10ms WASAPI/CoreAudio)
   - Device enumeration, configuration, latency reporting
   - Interface: `IAudioDriver` (matching OCC027)

5. **Performance Monitor** (Months 4-5)
   - Real-time diagnostics: CPU usage, buffer underruns, latency

## Key Insights from SDK Analysis

### Current SDK Strengths
1. **Deterministic offline rendering** - Excellent foundation for export features
2. **ABI versioning system** - Critical for long-term stability
3. **JSON session serialization** - Matches OCC data model perfectly
4. **Clean architecture** - Easy to extend without breaking existing code

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **No real-time playback engine** - Must build from scratch
2. **No audio driver integration** - Platform-specific work required
3. **No multi-channel routing** - Essential for professional use
4. **No performance monitoring** - Needed for troubleshooting

### SDK vs OCC Responsibilities (Clear Separation)
**SDK Provides:**
- Sample-accurate transport control
- Audio file I/O and decoding
- Multi-channel routing matrix
- Platform audio drivers (CoreAudio, ASIO, WASAPI)
- Performance diagnostics

**OCC Implements:**
- Clip grid UI and triggering logic
- Waveform editor with mouse controls
- Session management (save/load/auto-save)
- Remote control servers (iOS, WebSocket, OSC, MIDI)
- Recording workflows
- Cloud sync and logging

### Parallel Development Strategy
**Enables:**
- OCC team starts UI work immediately (Month 1) using stubs
- SDK team builds real implementations in parallel
- Integration in Month 3 (no critical path blocking)
- Risk reduction: Both teams can proceed independently

## Open Questions for Decision (From OCC029)

### SDK Architecture
1. Should `ITransportController` manage clip fades, or OCC? **Rec:** SDK handles (consistency)
2. Should routing matrix support aux sends in MVP? **Rec:** Defer to v1.0
3. Should `IAudioFileReader` support network streaming? **Rec:** Local files only for MVP

### Build System
4. Should real-time modules be optional (CMake flag)? **Rec:** Optional, default ON
5. Should SDK bundle libsndfile? **Rec:** External installation (document in README)

### Testing & QA
6. Should CI run 24-hour stability tests? **Rec:** Manual/nightly only (too slow for CI)
7. Should SDK provide example application? **Rec:** Yes, create `examples/simple_player/`
