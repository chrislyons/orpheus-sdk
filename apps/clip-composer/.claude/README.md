# Clip Composer Development Progress Tracking

**Location:** `/apps/clip-composer/.claude/`
**Purpose:** Track implementation progress for Orpheus Clip Composer application

---

## Directory Contents

### implementation_progress.md
**Purpose:** Living document tracking month-by-month implementation progress
**Update Frequency:** Weekly (after each major milestone)
**Contents:**
- Current phase status
- Completed tasks
- Pending tasks
- Blockers and dependencies
- Next steps

### Session Reports (Future)
When significant implementation work is completed, session reports will be created here:
- `SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Detailed narrative of work completed
- Technical highlights
- File inventory
- Lessons learned

---

## How to Use This Directory

### Starting a New Development Session
1. Read `implementation_progress.md` for current status
2. Check "Next Steps" section for prioritized tasks
3. Review any blockers or SDK dependencies
4. Update progress doc as you work

### Completing a Development Session
1. Update `implementation_progress.md` with accomplishments
2. Mark completed tasks as ‚úÖ
3. Add new tasks discovered during implementation
4. Document any blockers or issues
5. Update "Next Steps" for next session

### Before Major Milestones
1. Create session report documenting completed work
2. Update metrics (lines of code, tests added, etc.)
3. Verify acceptance criteria from `/docs/OCC/OCC026`
4. Coordinate with SDK team on dependencies

## Progress Tracking Philosophy

**For Clip Composer Application:**
- Focus on OCC-specific implementation (UI, session management, etc.)
- Track SDK integration separately (not SDK module development)
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Keep progress docs synchronized with actual code state

**Not Tracked Here:**
- Orpheus SDK module development (tracked in `/.claude/` at repo root)
- Design work (tracked in `/docs/OCC/`)
- Build system changes (tracked via git commits)

---

## Quick Reference: Key Milestones

From `docs/OCC/OCC026` and `docs/OCC/OCC030`:

### Month 1-2: SDK Integration ‚úÖ (SDK Ready) / üîÑ (OCC In Progress)
**Goal:** Basic clip playback working
- Set up JUCE project structure
- Integrate Orpheus SDK headers/libraries
- Build "Hello World" OCC with dummy audio driver
- Load a single clip and play it back
- Verify audio callback integration

### Month 3-4: Core UI ‚è≥
**Goal:** 960-button clip grid and transport controls
- Implement ClipGrid component (10√ó12 √ó 8 tabs)
- Add transport controls (play, stop, panic)
- Implement session loading (JSON parsing)
- Add waveform display
- Integrate keyboard shortcuts

### Month 3-4: Routing & Mixing ‚è≥ (Blocked on SDK IRoutingMatrix)
**Goal:** 4 Clip Groups with routing controls
- Wait for SDK IRoutingMatrix implementation
- Build routing panel UI
- Assign clips to groups
- Test 16 simultaneous clips with routing

### Month 5-6: Advanced Features ‚è≥
**Goal:** Waveform editor, remote control, diagnostics
- Implement waveform editor (trim IN/OUT, cue points)
- Add performance monitor UI (CPU meter, latency display)
- Integrate OSC server for remote control (iOS app)
- Add session save/load with metadata
- Polish UI (themes, accessibility)

### Month 6: Beta & Polish üéØ
**Goal:** MVP ready for beta testing
- Recruit 10 beta testers
- Fix critical bugs
- Optimize performance (CPU, memory, latency)
- Verify cross-platform compatibility (macOS + Windows)
- Write user documentation

## Metrics to Track

**Implementation Progress:**
- Lines of code written
- Components implemented
- Tests added (unit + integration)
- Design decisions documented

**Quality Metrics:**
- Test coverage (target 80%+)
- Performance (CPU usage, latency)
- Stability (crash-free hours)
- Memory usage

**Milestone Completion:**
- Tasks completed vs planned
- Blockers resolved
- Dependencies satisfied
- Acceptance criteria met

---

## Coordination with SDK Team

**Track SDK Dependencies:**
- IRoutingMatrix availability (Month 3-4)
- Platform audio drivers (Month 2)
- IPerformanceMonitor (Month 4-5)

**Communication:**
- Weekly sync meetings (Fridays)
- Slack channel: `#orpheus-occ-integration`
- GitHub issues tagged `occ-blocker`

**Report Issues:**
- SDK API mismatches
- Performance problems in SDK modules
- Missing functionality needed for OCC
- Cross-platform bugs

---

## File Naming Conventions

**Progress Documents:**
- `implementation_progress.md` - Living document (continuously updated)

**Session Reports:**
- `SESSION_2025-10-12.md` - Date of session completion
- `SESSION_2025-11-15.md` - One report per major milestone

**Validation Reports:**
- `VALIDATION_MONTH_X.md` - End-of-month validation checklist
