# Clip Composer Development Progress Tracking

**Location:** `/apps/clip-composer/.claude/`
**Purpose:** Track implementation progress for Orpheus Clip Composer application

---

## Directory Contents

### implementation_progress.md

**Purpose:** Living document tracking month-by-month implementation progress
**Update Frequency:** Weekly (after each major milestone)
**Contents:**

- Current phase status
- Completed tasks
- Pending tasks
- Blockers and dependencies
- Next steps

### Session Reports (Future)

When significant implementation work is completed, session reports will be created here:

- `SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Detailed narrative of work completed
- Technical highlights
- File inventory
- Lessons learned

---

## How to Use This Directory

### Starting a New Development Session

1. Read `implementation_progress.md` for current status
2. Check "Next Steps" section for prioritized tasks
3. Review any blockers or SDK dependencies
4. Update progress doc as you work

### Completing a Development Session

1. Update `implementation_progress.md` with accomplishments
2. Mark completed tasks as ✅
3. Add new tasks discovered during implementation
4. Document any blockers or issues
5. Update "Next Steps" for next session

### Before Major Milestones

1. Create session report documenting completed work
2. Update metrics (lines of code, tests added, etc.)
3. Verify acceptance criteria from `/docs/OCC/OCC026`
4. Coordinate with SDK team on dependencies

## Progress Tracking Philosophy

**For Clip Composer Application:**

- Focus on OCC-specific implementation (UI, session management, etc.)
- Track SDK integration separately (not SDK module development)
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Keep progress docs synchronized with actual code state

**Not Tracked Here:**

- Orpheus SDK module development (tracked in `/.claude/` at repo root)
- Design work (tracked in `/docs/OCC/`)
- Build system changes (tracked via git commits)

---

## Quick Reference: Key Milestones

- Trim info label (M:SS duration format)
- Fade In/Out sliders (0.0-3.0s, 0.1s increments)
- Curve selection (Linear, Equal Power, Exponential)
- Independent fade in/out curves
- Extended SessionManager.ClipData with 6 new fields
- Complete save/load for all Phase 2 & 3 fields

### Phase 4: Build & Release ✅ (Complete - Oct 22, 2025)

**Goal:** First public alpha release

- Built arm64 binary for Apple Silicon

- DMG uploaded and available for download

### v0.2.0 Planning ⏳ (In Progress)

**Goal:** Optimize and enhance based on alpha feedback

- Fix Release build linker issues
- Wire fade curves to AudioEngine (apply during playback)
- Interactive trim handles (drag handles on waveform)
- Sample rate auto-conversion (48kHz engine, any file format)
- Beta testing with 5-10 broadcast/theater users
- Bug fixes from alpha feedback

## Metrics to Track

**Implementation Progress:**

- Lines of code written
- Components implemented
- Tests added (unit + integration)
- Design decisions documented

**Quality Metrics:**

- Test coverage (target 80%+)
- Performance (CPU usage, latency)
- Stability (crash-free hours)
- Memory usage

**Milestone Completion:**
