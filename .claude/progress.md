- Event frequency validation uses 1μs epsilon for floating-point comparison tolerance
- UI components use existing elevenlabs-ui component library (Button, Card, Input, Label, Slider, Progress, ScrollArea)
- Track Manager operates in UI-only mode until AddTrack/RemoveTrack commands are added to contract

## Notes for AI Assistants

**To Resume:**
- Say "Continue with ORP068" or "Pick up where we left off"
- Reference this file: `.claude/progress.md`
- Check git status: `git log --oneline -5`

**Key Constraints:**
- Offline-first (no network calls in core)
- Deterministic (sample-accurate, bit-identical)
- Host-neutral (works across REAPER, standalone, plugins)
- Broadcast-safe (no allocations in audio thread)

**Package Naming:**
- All publishable packages: `@orpheus/*` scope
- Preserve "Shmui" codename in `@orpheus/shmui`
- Reserved: `@orpheus/core`, `@orpheus/client`, `@orpheus/contract`

**Validation Gates:**
- Each phase has validation script: `scripts/validate-phase{0-4}.sh`
- Must pass before advancing to next phase
- CI enforces: clang-format, ctest, lint-js
