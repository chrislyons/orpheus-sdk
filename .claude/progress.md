- `d8910fce` - Phase 0 complete + @orpheus/contract package (2025-10-11)

## Critical Path

**Week 3-4 (Current):**
1. Service Driver (orpheusd) → P1.DRIV.001-004
2. Native Driver (N-API bindings) → P1.DRIV.005-007
3. Client Broker → P1.DRIV.008-010

**Week 5-6:**
4. React integration → P1.UI.001-002
5. Phase 1 validation → P1.TEST.001

**Blockers:** None currently. Contract package unblocks all driver work.

## Notes for AI Assistants

**To Resume:**
- Say "Continue with ORP068" or "Pick up where we left off"
- Reference this file: `.claude/progress.md`
- Check git status: `git log --oneline -5`

**Key Constraints:**
- Offline-first (no network calls in core)
- Deterministic (sample-accurate, bit-identical)
- Host-neutral (works across REAPER, standalone, plugins)
- Broadcast-safe (no allocations in audio thread)

**Package Naming:**
- All publishable packages: `@orpheus/*` scope
- Preserve "Shmui" codename in `@orpheus/shmui`
- Reserved: `@orpheus/core`, `@orpheus/client`, `@orpheus/contract`

**Validation Gates:**
- Each phase has validation script: `scripts/validate-phase{0-4}.sh`
- Must pass before advancing to next phase
- CI enforces: clang-format, ctest, lint-js
