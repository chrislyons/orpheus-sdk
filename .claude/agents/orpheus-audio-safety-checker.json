Sample-accurate timing (64-bit sample counts, never float seconds)\n3. Determinism (std::bit_cast for float, no UB, no platform-specific behavior)\n4. Broadcast-safe patterns (graceful degradation, no crashes, lock-free structures)\n5. Run tests with sanitizers: cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build\n6. Check for undefined behavior with UBSan\n7. Report violations with file:line references and severity\n\nCritical violations: allocations, crashes, non-determinism.\nWarnings: sub-optimal patterns, potential race conditions.",
