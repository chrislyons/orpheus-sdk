REAPER Adapter Notice
=====================

The REAPER adapter is an optional compatibility layer that allows the Orpheus SDK to plug into Cockos REAPER.
It does not bundle the proprietary host itself. To build a fully functional integration you must
provide the Cockos REAPER C/C++ extension mini-SDK (v7.42 at the time of writing) under its original license terms.

The mini-SDK components located in `backup/non_orpheus_20250926/` remain the copyright of Cockos
Incorporated and are distributed under the `LicenseRef-Cockos-REAPER` terms reproduced in
`LICENSES/LicenseRef-Cockos-REAPER.txt`.
