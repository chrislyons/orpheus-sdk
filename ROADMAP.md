# Roadmap

The Orpheus roadmap captures the near-term milestones for evolving the SDK and
its adapters. Updated October 2025 to include real-time infrastructure for
Orpheus Clip Composer and future applications.

## Milestone M1 – Foundations (COMPLETE)

* ✅ Quarantine legacy, non-Orpheus code and establish a clean repository.
* ✅ Create core ABI/session primitives with a modern CMake superbuild.
* ✅ Provide Hello World adapters (REAPER panel, minhost click renderer).
* ✅ Enable smoke testing, sanitizers, and cross-platform CI.

## Milestone M2 – Real-Time Infrastructure (Months 1-6, 2025)

**Purpose:** Enable real-time audio playback for Orpheus Clip Composer MVP and
future applications requiring sample-accurate, low-latency performance.

**Core Modules:**

* **Transport Controller** (Months 1-2)
  - Sample-accurate clip playback with start/stop control
  - Lock-free audio thread with command queue
  - Transport callbacks (clip started/stopped/looped)
  - Multi-clip playback (16+ simultaneous clips)

* **Audio File Reader** (Months 1-2)
  - Decode WAV/AIFF/FLAC using libsndfile
  - Stream audio data into ring buffers (non-blocking)
  - Sample rate conversion, file integrity verification
  - Background loading for low-latency triggering

* **Platform Audio Drivers** (Months 1-2)
  - CoreAudio (macOS), WASAPI (Windows), ASIO (Windows professional)
  - Low-latency I/O (<5ms ASIO, <10ms WASAPI/CoreAudio)
  - Device enumeration, configuration, latency reporting

* **AES67 Network Audio Driver** (Optional, Months 2-3)
  - IP audio transport via AES67/RTP (RFC 3550)
  - PTP clock synchronization (IEEE 1588) for sample-accurate alignment
  - Multicast stream send/receive (up to 128 network channels)
  - Interoperability with Dante, Ravenna, Q-LAN ecosystems
  - See `docs/ORP/ORP071.md` for full integration plan

* **Routing Matrix** (Months 3-4)
  - Professional N×M routing (64 channels → 16 groups → 32 outputs)
  - Real-time gain/pan adjustment with click-free smoothing
  - Multiple solo modes (SIP, AFL, PFL), mute controls, per-clip routing
  - Real-time metering (Peak, RMS, TruePeak, LUFS)
  - Snapshot/preset system for instant recall

* **Performance Monitor** (Months 4-5)
  - Real-time diagnostics: CPU usage, buffer underruns, latency
  - Thread-safe queries, memory tracking
  - Per-clip CPU breakdown (optional profiling)

**Testing & Quality:**
- Unit tests for sample-accurate timing (±1 sample tolerance)
- Integration tests (16 simultaneous clips, latency <10ms)
- Stress tests (24-hour stability, rapid trigger 100/sec)
- Cross-platform validation (macOS + Windows)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Single-clip playback working (Month 2)
- ✅ 16 simultaneous clips, CPU <30% (Month 4)
- ✅ OCC MVP integration complete (Month 6)

**Documentation:**
- Doxygen API docs for all public interfaces
- Integration guide for application developers
- Platform-specific guides (CoreAudio, ASIO/WASAPI)

**Implementation Plans:**
- **ORP068** - SDK Integration Plan v2.0 (driver architecture, contracts, client integration)
- **ORP069** - OCC-Aligned SDK Enhancements (platform drivers, routing, performance monitoring)
- These plans run in parallel with coordinated timelines and shared validation checkpoints

## Milestone M3 – Feature Expansion

* Extend the core library with richer session models (tempo, markers, media).
* Flesh out the REAPER adapter with interactive UI surfaces and message routing.
* Add audio rendering scenarios to the minhost (streamed audio, bus routing).
* Introduce integration tests that exercise host ↔ adapter handshakes.

## Milestone M4 – Recording & DSP (Months 7-12, 2025-2026)

**Purpose:** Support advanced features for Orpheus Clip Composer v1.0 and enable
creative workflows for FX Engine.

**Core Modules:**

* **Input Audio Graphs** (Months 7-9)
  - Capture input from audio drivers (recording)
  - Buffer management for real-time recording
  - Disk streaming (WAV/AIFF file writer)

* **DSP Processing** (Months 10-12)
  - Pluggable DSP processor interface
  - Rubber Band integration (time-stretch, pitch-shift)
  - Real-time parameter updates
  - Quality vs performance profiles

* **Remote Control Protocols** (Months 10-12)
  - WebSocket server (iOS companion app)
  - OSC integration (Open Sound Control)
  - MIDI control mapping
  - Command registration API

**Applications Enabled:**
- OCC v1.0: Recording directly into buttons, DSP processing
- FX Engine: LLM-powered effects, real-time parameter automation
- Wave Finder: Real-time frequency analysis

## Milestone M5 – Production Readiness
