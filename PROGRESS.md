## ORP128 — CoreAudio runtime sample-rate resilience

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Branch:** `feat/orp128-coreaudio-rate-resilience`  
**Status:** Sprint 1 implementation and focused verification complete; commit and remote delivery pending.

### Delivered

- Active CoreAudio routes now register nominal-sample-rate listeners for the AU
  route and every physical input/output endpoint.
- Listener notifications only close an atomic render gate and signal a control
  worker. The worker reasserts the configured rate outside the render callback.
- A refused reassertion or rate-query failure stops rendering and is exposed as
  `AudioIoTelemetry::runtime_outcome`; hosts must explicitly reinitialize.
- Explicit directional endpoint IDs remain immutable. The driver does not
  select a fallback device, rebuild an AudioUnit, resample, or invoke a host
  callback while a rate mismatch is pending.

### Evidence

- ASan/UBSan Debug focused CoreAudio suite passed 12 contracts, covering all
  deterministic monitor outcomes plus live playback-route startup,
  initialization, admitted-callback teardown, directional routes, aggregate
  capture, duplex capture, and capture-failure telemetry.
- Deterministic fake-property coverage proves listener registration/removal,
  no post-teardown callback, successful recovery, refused recovery, query
  failure, and rendering gate behavior.
- `tools/realtime_audit.py --root . --fail-known-debt` passed with zero hard
  failures and zero tracked-debt findings.

### Configured-suite observation

- The three failing commands were `docs_path_audit` (eight missing document
  links), `cmake_shmui_package_consumer` (unexported JUCE dependencies), and
  `coreaudio_driver_test`.
- On this host, 12 legacy CoreAudio cases that rely on the default
  two-input-channel configuration return `InvalidParameter`; the same run
  passed the focused output, directional, aggregate, and capture contracts
  listed above. This record does not treat the complete suite as green.

### Limitation

No controllable macOS device was available locally to record a live nominal
48 kHz → 44.1 kHz transition or rejected reassertion. The deterministic fake
covers both paths; no hardware recovery/refusal support claim is made.
