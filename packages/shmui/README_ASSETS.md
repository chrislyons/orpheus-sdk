# Shmui Asset Handling

Binary assets such as images, audio, or downloadable archives are stored in external storage.

For development builds, sync the required assets into the `public/`, `static/`, or `assets/` directories
before running the UI. These directories remain in the repository with `.keep` placeholders to maintain
structure without committing binaries.
